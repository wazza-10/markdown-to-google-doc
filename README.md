# Markdown to Google Docs Formatter

This project is a Python script that converts markdown-formatted meeting notes into a well-formatted Google Doc. It uses the Google Docs API to programmatically create a Google Document and applies proper styling, including headings, bullet points, checkboxes, and more.

## Features

- Converts markdown meeting notes into a Google Doc.
- Applies formatting:
  - Main title as **Heading 1**.
  - Section headers as **Heading 2**.
  - Sub-section headers as **Heading 3**.
  - Properly nested bullet points.
  - Markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]`) converted to actual Google Docs checkboxes.
  - Mentions (`@name`) preserved with distinct styling.
  - Footer information styled separately.
- Shares the created Google Doc with the specified email.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable Google APIs
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. Enable the following APIs for your project:
   - **Google Docs API**
   - **Google Drive API**

### Step 2: Create a Service Account
1. Navigate to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**.
2. Create a new service account.
3. Assign the service account the role of **Editor** or higher.
4. Generate a JSON key for the service account:
   - Go to the **Keys** tab and click **Add Key > Create New Key**.
   - Download the JSON file and save it securely.

### Step 3: Upload the JSON File
- Upload the service account JSON file to your Colab environment or keep it accessible locally.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth google-auth-oauthlib
```
### Step 2: Add the JSON Key
- Update the SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE variable in the script with the path to your JSON file: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'file-path.json'

### Step 3: Run the Script
1. Open the Colab notebook or the script.
2. Execute the cells or run the script.
3. The script will:
   * Create a new Google Doc.
   * Format it based on the markdown input.
   * Share it with the specified email.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
 * google-api-python-client
 * google-auth
 * google-auth-oauthlib

## TroubleShooting
1. 403 Forbidden Error (Insufficient Permissions):
   * Ensure the service account has the correct role (Editor or higher).
   * Verify the API scopes include both ```https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents```and ```https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.```
2. Access Request for the Google Doc:
   * Ensure the script shares the document with the correct email address.
   * Verify the share_document function in the script.

## Deliverables
1. Python Script: Includes the logic for markdown-to-Google-Doc conversion.
2. Colab Notebook: A step-by-step implementation of the script.
3. Sample Output: Link to a sample Google Doc generated by the script.
